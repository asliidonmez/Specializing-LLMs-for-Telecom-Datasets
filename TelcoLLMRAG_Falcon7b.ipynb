This is in line with the requirements of two major regulatory bodies and summarized as follows:\\nTable A.1-1: Accuracy requirements for emergency calls Figure 7.6-1: Handling of location information in IMS emergency calls\\n1.\\tThe user initiates an emergency call.\\n2.\\tThe UE determines its own location or location identifier if possible. If the UE is not able to determine its own location, the UE may, if capable, request its location information from the IP-CAN, if that is supported for the used IP-CAN. If applicable, the IP-CAN delivers to the UE the UE's geographical location information and/or the location identifier.\\n3.\\tThe UE sends an INVITE with an emergency indication to the IMS core. The INVITE should contain any location information that the terminal has. The location information may be geographical location information or a location identifier, which is dependent upon the access network technology. If the UE is not able to provide any location information, the IMS core may seek to determine the UE's location from the LRF as described below. The INVITE may optionally contain information concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE.\\nNOTE:\\tThe location solutions and position methods conveyed in the INVITE and the means of inclusion in the INVITE are outside the scope of this specification.\\n4.\\tIf the location information provided in step\\u00a03 is trusted and sufficient to determine the correct PSAP, the procedure continues from step 7 onwards. If the location information is insufficient or if the IMS core requires emergency routing information, or if the IMS core is required to validate the location information, or if the IMS core is required to map the location identifier received from the UE into the corresponding geographical location information, the IMS core sends a location request to the LRF. The request shall include information identifying the IP-CAN and the UE and may include means to access the UE (e.g. UE's IP address). The request shall also include any location information provided by the UE in step 2. The request may optionally include any information concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE.\\n5.\\tThe LRF may already have the information requested by IMS core or LRF may request the UE's location information.\\n5a.\\tThe means to obtain the location information may differ depending on the access technology the UE is using to access the IMS. The SUPL procedures defined in OMA AD SUPL: \\\"Secure User Plane Location Architecture\\\" [15], OMA TS ULP: \\\"User Plane Location Protocol\\\" [16], may be used if supported by the terminal and if it is possible to establish a user plane connection between the UE and the SUPL server. Information provided in step 4 concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE may optionally be used by the LRF to help determine the means to obtain the location information.\\n5b.\\tIf configured to provide an NPLI for WLAN access, and if the UE is not roaming, the LRF queries HSS for every access the LRF is configured for. The LRF issues a separate query for every access. If the LRF cannot obtain an NPLI, it shall invoke procedure 5a.\\n\\tThe LRF may invoke an RDF to convert the location information received in step\\u00a04 or obtained in step\\u00a05a into PSAP routing information, but LRF's interactions with RDF are out of scope of the present specification. The LRF may store the location information, but only for a defined limited time in certain regions, according to regional requirements.\\n6.\\tThe LRF sends the location information and/or the routing information to the IMS core. The LRF may also return correlation information (e.g. ESQK) identifying itself and any record stored in step\\u00a05a.\\n7.\\tThe IMS core uses the routing information provided in step\\u00a06 or selects an emergency centre or PSAP based on location information provided in step\\u00a03 or 6 and sends the request including the location information and any correlation information and possibly location information source, e.g., positioning method that was used to obtain the location information to the emergency centre or PSAP.\\n7a.\\tThe INVITE is sent to an MGCF/MGW;\\n7b.\\tThe IAM is continued towards the emergency centre or PSAP; or\\n7c.\\tThe INVITE is sent directly to the emergency centre or PSAP.\\n8.\\tThe emergency call establishment is completed.\\n9.\\tThe PSAP may send a location request to the LRF to get the initial location information for the target UE, or to request LRF to get updated, i.e. current, location information for the target UE. The PSAP may determine the LRF based on the location and/or correlation information received in step\\u00a07. The PSAP may also include the correlation information in the request to the LRF.\\n10.\\tDepending on the access type, UE location is determined as follows:\\n10a.\\tFor non WLAN-access and optionally for WLAN access, the LRF determines the target UE's location using one of the means listed in step 5a above. The LRF may use the correlation information received in step\\u00a09 to retrieve information about the UE that was stored in step\\u00a05a.\\n10b.\\tFor WLAN access, the LRF may use the correlation information received in step\\u00a06 to send a request to the IMS core to retrieve a UPLI from the UE. The IMS core uses the emergency call signalling channel for that purpose. Steps 10b1 to 10b4 depict this procedure. If UPLI is not available when the request comes to the UE (e.g. due to insufficient time), and UPLI cannot be returned, the UE may also provide UPLI once, when available by executing step\\u00a010b3 following step\\u00a08.\\n10c.\\tFor WLAN access, and if the LRF is configured to provide an NPLI for WLAN access, and if the UE is not roaming, the LRF queries HSS for every access the LRF is configured for. The LRF issues a separate query for every access. If the LRF cannot obtain an NPLI, it shall invoke procedure 10a.\\n11.\\tThe LRF returns the initial or updated location information to the emergency centre or PSAP. As an option for initial location, the LRF may instigate the location step\\u00a010a before the request in step\\u00a09 is received and may send the initial location to the emergency centre or PSAP either after the request in step\\u00a09 is received or before it is received.\\n12.\\tThe emergency call is released.\\n13.\\tThe IMS core may indicate to the LRF that the call is released. The LRF deletes any record stored in step\\u00a05a.\\n7.6.2\\tVoid NOTE\\u00a01:\\tIt is not possible for a UE to indicate more than one type of emergency service in an emergency service URN.\\nIf:\\n-\\tthe UE considers itself in the country of the HPLMN;\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tIt is out of scope of the present annex to define how the UE determines whether it considered itself in the country of the HPLMN. When the UE is in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can, for example, use the information derived from the available PLMN(s). In this case, the UE can match the MCC broadcasted on the BCCH of the 3GPP access against the UE's IMSI to determine if they belong to the same country, as defined in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.122\\u00a0[4C].

Emergency PDU session is defined for use in emergency calls in 5GS and core network support of emergency PDU session is indicated to the UE in NAS signalling. Where the UE recognises that a call request is an emergency call and the core network supports emergency PDU session, the UE shall use emergency PDU session for both signalling and media for emergency calls made using the IM CN subsystem.\\nSome jurisdictions allow emergency calls to be made when the UE does not contain an UICC, or where the credentials are not accepted. Additionally, where the UE is in state 5GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE or 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, a normal registration in 5GS has been attempted but it can also be assumed that a registration in the IM CN subsystem will also fail. In such cases, subject to the lower layers indicating that the network does support emergency bearer services in limited service state (see 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a036.331\\u00a0[19F] or 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a038.331\\u00a0[19G]), the procedures for emergency calls without registration can be applied, as defined in subclause\\u00a05.1.6.8.2. If the 5GS primary authentication procedure has already succeeded during the latest normal or emergency registration procedure in 5GS, the UE shall perform an initial emergency registration, as described in subclause\\u00a05.1.6.2 before attempting an emergency call as described in subclause\\u00a05.1.6.8.3.\\nNOTE\\u00a01:\\tThe UE can determine that 5GS primary authentication procedure has succeeded during the emergency registration procedure in 5GS when a non-null integrity protection algorithm (i.e. other than 5G-IA0 algorithm) is received in the NAS signalling SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.\\nTo perform emergency registration, the UE shall request to establish an emergency PDU session as described in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a024.501\\u00a0[258].

The IP address used for signalling purposes is allocated in association with step 3 or step 4. The IMS registration request shall include an emergency indication. The implicit registration set of the SIP URI used in the emergency registration request used by the UE when the UE performs a non-emergency registration shall contain an associated TEL-URI that is used to call back the UE.\\n\\tThe S-CSCF may set the proposed registration expiration according to the local regulation or operator policy of the serving system. The subsequent registration flows are like any other registration with the considerations defined in clauses 6.2.4 and 6.2.9.\\n\\tIf the UE does not have sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS network, it shall not initiate an IMS emergency registration request, but instead immediately establish an emergency session towards the P-CSCF as described in clause\\u00a07.4 and skip step\\u00a07.\\n7.\\tThe UE shall initiate the IMS emergency session establishment using the IMS session establishment procedures containing an emergency service indication, or the eCall type of emergency service indication in the case of eCall and any registered Public User Identifier. If the UE has performed emergency registration, the UE shall use an emergency registered Public User Identifier.\\nWhether the procedures are activated individually by the UE or some of them are performed automatically depends on the implementation of the terminal and on the UE's configuration. For instance, the multimedia application in the UE could start the application level registration and steps 2-4 would have to be executed in response to support the operation initiated by the application. Interaction with the UE may happen during these steps.\\n7.1.2\\tNon UE detectable Emergency Session\\nAs the UE could not detect the emergency session, the session establishment request will be sent to a P-CSCF in the visited PLMN or a P-CSCF in the home PLMN as per a normal session establishment procedure. The former is only applicable to a roaming situation whereas the latter can apply to both a roaming and non-roaming situation and for the case of SNPN. Prior to sending the session establishment request the UE must be registered in the IMS as per the normal registration procedure.\\nIn the case that the P-CSCF detects that this is a request to establish an emergency session, based upon operator policy (e.g., checking access type):\\n-\\tthe P-CSCF may reject the session initiation request with an indication that this is for an emergency session. When the UE receives the session rejection then the UE shall:\\n-\\tselect a domain for the emergency session;\\n-\\tif the PS domain is selected, follow the procedure in clause\\u00a07.1.1;\\n-\\tfor systems based on TS\\u00a024.008\\u00a0[13], if the CS domain is selected and a dialled number is available, attempt a normal call (i.e. TS\\u00a011, see TS\\u00a022.003\\u00a0[26]) using the dialled number if:\\n-\\tan emergency service information is included by the P-CSCF with either a country specific emergency subservice type (see TS\\u00a024.229\\u00a0[19]) or a emergency subservice type (see TS\\u00a024.229\\u00a0[19]) that does not map into an emergency service category for the CS domain; or\\n-\\tno emergency service information is included by the P-CSCF;\\n-\\tfor systems based on TS\\u00a024.008\\u00a0[13], if the CS domain is selected, attempt an emergency call (i.e. TS\\u00a012, see TS\\u00a022.003\\u00a0[26]) if:\\n-\\ta dialled number is not available; or\\n-\\tan emergency service information is included by the P-CSCF with no emergency subservice type or a emergency subservice type (see TS\\u00a024.229\\u00a0[19]) that maps into an emergency service category for the CS domain;\\n-\\tif the CS domain is selected and for CS systems that do not support emergency call handling procedures (e.g. as described by TS12 in TS\\u00a022.003\\u00a0[26] for systems based on TS\\u00a024.008\\u00a0[13] or in systems providing access to IM CN subsystem using a cdma2000 network, for example) a normal call is made;\\n-\\tIf prior attempting the call in the CS domain the UE receives a list of local emergency numbers, the UE may verify if and recognizes the dialled number is an emergency number and if verified, the UE shall attempt an emergency call set up indicating the appropriate emergency call type.\\n-\\tAlternatively, the P-CSCF in the visited PLMN or the P-CSCF in the home PLMN for a non-roaming UE may allow the session initiation request to continue by inserting the explicit emergency indication in the session request. The P-CSCF in the visited PLMN forwards that request to an Emergency CSCF in the same network. The P-CSCF in the home PLMN for a non-roaming UE may forward that request to a Serving CSCF or to an Emergency CSCF in the same network, based on local regulation or operator policy. The E-CSCF shall inform the UE that the session has been marked as an emergency session so the UE can treat the session as an emergency session establishment.\\n-\\tFor the case when a SNPN uses IMS services provided by an independent IMS provider, the P-CSCF is located in the IMS provider network according to TS\\u00a023.228\\u00a0[1], Annex\\u00a0A.\\nIf the AS detects that this is a request to establish an emergency session, the AS shall handle the request as specified in clause\\u00a06.2.8 and forward the request marked as an emergency services request to the S-CSCF.\\n7.1.3\\tEmergency Session Establishment using LRF/RDF\\nFigure 7.2 illustrates a high level call flow for the IMS emergency session establishment procedure using LRF/RDF to retrieve location and routing information. 13\\tSecurity aspects of emergency call handling \\n13.1\\tGeneral\\nNOTE:\\tSupport for EPS emergency calling is defined in the TS\\u00a023.402 [5]. Per TS\\u00a023.402 [5], this release of this specification is limited to support of handover of emergency sessions from E-UTRAN access to HRPD access only. In this release of this specification, handover of IMS Emergency Sessions from HRPD access to E-UTRAN access is not supported.\\n\\tSupport for IMS Emergency sessions over an WLAN access is supported as specified in subclause 4.5.7.2 of TS 23.402[5].

If the HRPD network chooses to perform authentication and authorization at the handover and either one of them fail, then it is up to operator policy and local regulatory requirements whether the UE shall be allowed to get service from the HRPD network.\\nIf the UE has established an unauthenticated emergency call in E-UTRAN and attempts a handover to HRPD, then it is up to local regulations and operator policy if the UE shall receive service from HRPD network. E-UTRAN provides an indication to HRPD access whether the UE has been authenticated in E-UTRAN or not, as described in TS 23.402 [5]. \\n13.3\\tUnauthenticated emergency calls over untrusted WLAN\",\n          \"A.2.2\\tFactory automation\\nA.2.2.1\\tMotion control\\nA motion control system is responsible for controlling moving and/or rotating parts of machines in a well-defined manner, for example in printing machines, machine tools or packaging machines.\\nA schematic representation of a motion control system is depicted in Figure A.2.2.1-1. A motion controller periodically sends desired set points to one or several actuators (e.g., a linear actuator or a drive) which thereupon perform a corresponding action on one or several processes (in this case usually a movement or rotation of a certain component). At the same time, sensors determine the current state of the process(es), e.g. the current position and/or rotation of one or multiple components, and send the actual values back to the motion controller. This is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner, such that during one application cycle the motion controller sends updated set points to all actuators, and all sensors send their actual values back to the motion controller. Nowadays, typically Industrial Ethernet technologies are used for motion control systems. Figure 5.2.2.4-1: Identifying and triggering automation capabilities among\\nmultiple network automation functions\\nTo Orchestrate the decisions of AI/ML network automation functions, e.g. AI/ML inference functions or ML entities (see figure 5.2.2.4-2):\\n-\\tEach network automation function generates a recommendation which it proposes to the AIMLOrchestration for implementation. The AIMLOrchestration takes recommendations for changes from the network automation functions and takes a decision whether to implement the policy changes or not. The policy changes may be stated by the network automation functions as hash functions of parameter to parameter-values annotated with the time within which the values should be activated or else be discarded.\\n-\\tThe AIMLOrchestration undertake control tasks for the recommended and approved configuration changes, e.g. concurrency control, to ensure that their action will not conflict with other ongoing or proposed actions. In case of conflicts the AIMLOrchestration may choose to schedule the action to a different time from when it is proposed.\\n-\\tAt the right time, the AIMLOrchestration implements the action onto the network and subsequently manages the coordination. Use case one\\nTo keep a plant running, it is essential that the assets, such as pumps, valves, heaters, and instruments are maintained. Timely recognition of any degradation and continuous self-diagnosis of components are used to support and plan maintenance. Remote software updates enhance and adapt the components to changing conditions and advances in technology. \\nA.2.4\\tHuman machine interfaces\\nA.2.4.1\\tMobile control panels\\nControl panels are crucial devices for the interaction between people and production machinery as well as for the interaction with moving devices. These panels are mainly used for configuring, monitoring, debugging, controlling and maintaining machines, robots, cranes or complete production lines. In addition to that, (safety) control panels are typically equipped with an emergency stop button and an enabling device, which an operator can use in case of a safety event in order to avoid damage to humans or machinery. When the emergency stop button is pushed, the controlled equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary position. Likewise, if a machine, robot, etc. is operated in the so-called special \\u2018enabling device mode\\u2019, the operator manually keeps the enabling device switch in a special stationary position. If the operator pushes this switch too much or releases it, the controlled equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary position as well. This way, it can be ensured that the hand(s) of the operator are on the panel (and not under a moulding press, for example), and that the operator does\\u2015for instance\\u2015not suffer from any electric shock or the like. A common use case for this \\u2018enabling device mode\\u2019 is the installation, testing or maintenance of a machine, during which other safety mechanisms (such as a safety fence) are deactivated.\\nDue to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory. With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly. This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines. \\nThe cycle times of the control application depends on the process/machinery/equipment whose safety has to be ensured. For a fast-moving robot, for example, end-to-end latencies are lower than for slowly moving linear actuators. \\nTable A.2.4.1-1: Service performance requirements for mobile control panels NOTE:\\tBlue objects: communication system; other objects: automation application system.\\nFigure\\u00a0C.1.1-1: Abstract diagram of the area of consideration for industrial radio communication \\nHere, a distributed automation application system is depicted. This system includes a distributed automation application, which is the aggregation of several automation functions. These can be functions in sensors, measurement devices, drives, switches, I/O devices, encoders etc. All of these functions contribute toward the control of physical objects. Field bus systems, industrial Ethernet systems, or wireless communication systems can be used for connecting the distributed functions. The essential function of these communication systems is the distribution of messages among the distributed automation functions. For cyber-physical control applications, the dependability of the entire communication system and/or of its devices or its links is essential. Communication functions are realised by the respective hardware and software implementation.\\nIn order for the automation application system to operate, messages need to be exchanged between spatially distributed application functions. For that process, messages are exchanged at an interface between the automation application system and the communication system. This interface is termed the reference interface. Required and guaranteed values for characteristic parameters, which describe the behavioural properties of the radio communication system, as well as some influence quantities refer to that interface.\\nThe conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g., end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system (e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath propagation). \\nGeneral requirements from the application point of view for the time and failure behaviour of a communication system are mostly related to an end-to-end link. It is assumed in the present document that the behaviour of the link is representative of the communication system as a whole and of the entire scope of the application. \\nC.1.2\\tLogical link\\nC.1.2.1\\tNature and function\\nStarting with the general approach mentioned in Subclause C.1.1, the logical link can be regarded as a possible asset within the area of consideration (see Figure\\u00a0C.1.1-1). The conditions under which its functions are to be performed are vital for the dependability of the automation application system. Figure 5.2.2.4-2: Orchestrating the decision among multiple network automation functions\\nTo share knowledge and coordinate the impacts executed decisions of AI/ML network automation functions, e.g. AI/ML inference functions or ML entities (see figure 5.2.2.4-3):\\n-\\tThe AIMLOrchestration is a meta-learning agent responsible for learning if any of the availed network automation functions is behaving outside its expected region and for taking the accordingly appropriate counter-measures. So, for the activated configuration changes, the AIMLOrchestration manages the transaction among network automation functions that are intended to coordinate their actions and executions.\\n-\\tFollowing the execution of changes, the AIMLOrchestration triggers the other network automation functions (besides the one requesting the change) to start a monitoring period to identify any negative effects on their metrics.\\n-\\tAt the end of the observation period the network automation functions evaluate the effects of the changes and report to the AIMLOrchestration their network (metric) status observations in form of Action Quality Indicators. The network automation functions consume performance assurance (PM), fault supervision (FM) and provisioning (CM) services on their respective network elements and domains to evaluate the effect of the executed policy changes or configurations.\\n-\\tThe network automation functions report the observed effects in terms of the Action Quality Indicators to the AIMLOrchestration for aggregation. Note that, in a distributed implementation of the coordination, the Action Quality Indicators may also be reported directly to the network automation function which generated the action that was executed.\\n-\\tIn the subsequent AQI handling, the AIMLOrchestration evaluates the network status inputs from the multiple network automation functions and network domains to learn the effects of the configuration changes, i.e. the AIMLOrchestration determines if the effects are acceptable or not.\\n-\\tWhere a given change is determined to be out of the expected range, such a change needs to be labelled accordingly. For example, the change may be barred from ever being re-applied or from being reused in the specific context.\\n-\\tThe AIMLOrchestration informs the respective network automation function of the evaluation outcome (e.g. by sending the aggregate AQI). The AIMLOrchestration also accordingly re-configures the network automation functions, when necessary, e.g. by changing the network automation function's applicable control parameter spaces or its performance targets.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"merged_prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1460,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Context:\\nFigure 6.30.2-1: Processing AF requests to influence traffic routing for Sessions not identified by an UE address\\n-\\tIn step 1, the target of the AF request may refer a set of UEs as described in clause\\u00a06.30.1.\\n-\\tIn step 3 and 4, the data stored in UDR and the information sent to the PCF may refer to one of \\\"Allowed services\\\" and/or \\\"Subscriber categories\\\" as defined in TS\\u00a023.503\\u00a0[13] table\\u00a06.2-2.\\nClause\\u00a04.3.6.2 of TS\\u00a023.502\\u00a0[9] \\\"SM Policy Association Establishment\\\" is modified as follows: Figure 6.43.2.1-1: Procedure for FL member selection\\n1.\\tThe AF retrieves the user consent subscription data, indicating whether the network is allowed to expose UE related 5GC information, for the UEs in the candidate list from the UDM (via NEF if AF is untrusted) by invoking Nudm_SDM_Get service operation.\\n2.\\t[Optional]The AF requests the location reporting of the UEs from the AMF (via NEF if AF is untrusted) by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Location Reporting).\\n\\tThe AF should maintain the candidate UE list itself before FL member selection, and include the Target UE Identifier(s) for the UEs in the candidate list in the request as described in clause\\u00a05.6.7 of TS\\u00a023.501\\u00a0[3], which is same for step\\u00a02 and step\\u00a03.\\n3.\\tThe AF initiates direct notification of Qos Monitoring procedure for delay information for the UEs in the candidate list, as defined in steps 1a-5 of clause\\u00a06.4.2.1 of TS\\u00a023.548\\u00a0[10].\\n4.\\tThe AF requests user plane information, e.g. Throughput UL/DL, Packet transmission, Packet retransmission, for the UEs in the candidate list from UPF.\\nNOTE\\u00a01:\\tHow to collect data from UPF will depend on the outcome of FS-UPEAS SID.\\n5.\\tThe AF selects FL members based on user consent subscription data from UDM, UE location from AMF, and delay and packet drop information reporting from UPF.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tAF may keep monitoring the information from AMF/UPF/UDM to update FL members.\\n6.43.3\\tImpacts on services, entities and interfaces\\nAF:\\n-\\tSupporting user consent subscription data collection from UDM.\\n-\\tSupporting FL member selection based on the information from AMF, UDM and UPF.\\nUDM:\\n-\\tSupporting user consent information of whether the network is allowed to expose UE related 5GC information.\\nUPF:\\n-\\tSupporting to report user plane information to AF.\\n6.44\\tSolution #44: 5G assisted FL member selection for application request\\n6.44.1\\tDescription\\nThis solution is applied to KI#7: 5GS Assistance to Federated Learning Operation.\\nThis solution supports AF sends request to 5GS for a list of UEs with one or multiple restriction criterial, for example:\\n-\\tUEs in Connected state.\\n-\\tUEs in different location information.\\n-\\tUE QoS monitoring threshold.\\n-\\tService Experience threshold.\\nThe AIML function maybe co-located with NEF or deployed standalone and used for external exposure to assist 5G AIML service.

By this EDI is updated with EAS address field per DNAI and an indicator if the DNAI is selected for a group. The data in EDI is also updated with a Dynamic External Group Id that can be per DNAI or per application ID. The AF can use the Dynamic External Group ID and external application id to influence routing for a collection of UEs. The dynamic external group id is an identifier that is generated by the AF, i.e. it is not to be confused with the external group id configured in UDM. The AF associates a list of UEs with the dynamic external group id when requesting in AF influence on routing that the list of UEs should be using the same EAS and/or DNAI.\\nExample of EDI record before any group has been requested through traffic influence:\\nDNN-1/S-NSSAI-1:\\n\\tApplicationID-1\\n\\tFQDN\\n\\tDynExtGrID-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-2\\n\\tDNAI-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-4 \\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tDNAI-2\\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tetc.\\nExample of EDI record before after some groups have been requested through traffic influence:\\nDNN-1/S-NSSAI-1:\\n\\tApplicationID-1\\n\\tFQDN\\n\\tDynExtGrID-1\\n\\tDNAI-55\\n\\tEASaddr-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-2\\n\\tDNAI-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-4\\n\\tDNAI selection indicator\\n\\tEASaddr-3\\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tDNAI-2\\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tEASaddr-2\\n6.34.2\\tProcedure\\nThe following is the procedure for selecting the same EAS for collection of UEs accessing the same application.

Figure B.2.1.4-2 displays a calibration setup, where device D is replaced by device F. The mismatch contributions for this path are AB, BC, CE, ABC, BCE and ABCE. For a result based on the measurement and calibration stage, the mismatch contributions AB, BC, and ABC are matching pairs as they occur both in the measurement and calibration stage. Thus, they can be eliminated [11], and the system mismatch uncertainty is obtained as \\n\\nFigure B.2.1.4-2: Sketch of a calibration path Figure B.2.1.10-1: Calibration Setup Figure A-1. Example of ranging accuracy\\nAnnex B:\\nConsideration for reference of measurement\\nTo represent an object in some coordinates, it is important to set appropriate origin and reference axis, and for all parties to have same understanding of these. Table B.2.1.4-1: comprises the reflection and transmission properties of the components of the example path at a frequency of 43.5 GHz\\n\\nThe calculation of the overall mismatch uncertainty for a frequency of 43.5 GHz results in a value of 2.7 dB for the standard deviation, i.e., the expanded uncertainty is 5.3 dB.\\nFigure B.2.1.4-4 depicts a possible calibration for a part of the setup.\\n\\nFigure B.2.1.4-4: Block Diagram of the calibration stage B.2.1.11\\tInsertion loss Variation\\nThis uncertainty contribution comes from introducing an additional cable which is not present for both the calibration and DUT measurement. If the cables remain the same for the calibration and DUT measurement, then the contribution should be set to zero.\\nIf an additional cable is added for one part of the test, the insertion loss must be accounted for in the measurement results. If the insertion loss is measured the uncertainty contribution will be the combined uncertainty related to the insertion loss measurement. The insertion loss can also be taken from the datasheet and assumed to have a rectangular distribution.\\nB.2.1.12\\tRF leakage (from measurement antenna to receiver/transmitter)\\nThis contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between measurement antenna and receiving/transmitting equipment. The contribution also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between reference antenna and transmitting equipment for the calibration phase. This uncertainty contributor is contained in the contributor quality of quiet zone described in clause B.2.1.3 and its value therefore is set to zero.\\nB.2.1.13\\tMisalignment of positioning System\\nThis contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn table angle/tilt accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to the beam peak this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.\\nB.2.1.14\\tUncertainty of the Network Analyzer\\nThis contribution originates from all uncertainties involved transmission magnitude measurement with a network analyser, for example: drift, frequency flatness, temperature variation from kit calibration to path losses measurement as well as interpolation of calibration data if test frequencies were not calibrated during path loss characterization. The uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer's data sheet. It needs to be ensured that appropriate manufacturer's uncertainty contribution is specified for the absolute levels measured.\\nWhen an end-to-end system calibration approach is used, the absolute levels are related to the total system losses of the measurement path. When a split calibration approach is used, separate MU contributions need to be determined\\n-\\tu_cond: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the conducted portion of the calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system losses for the portion of the system calibrated \\n-\\tu_rad: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the radiated portion of the calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system losses for the portion of the system calibrated\\nThe total MU of the network analyser for the split calibration is the RSS\\u2019ed value of u_cond and u_rad.\\nB.2.1.15\\tUncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna\\nThe calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the gain uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty will come from a calibration report with traceability to a National Metrology Institute with measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the guidelines outlined in internationally accepted standards.\\nB.2.1.16\\tPositioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna and the measurement antenna\\nThis contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the reference antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.\\nB.2.1.17\\tgNB emulator uncertainty\\ngNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via multiple external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and  a circulator, etc.) in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level. Receiving device used is typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA. Generally there occurs uncertainty contribution from absolute level accuracy, non-linearity and frequency characteristic of the gNB emulator.\\nFor practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as calibration equipment, gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on the absolute level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be assumed as systematic. This uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer\\u2019s data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is included in the absolute level uncertainty.\\nB.2.1.18\\tPhase centre offset of calibration\\nGain is defined at the phase centre of the antenna. If the phase centre of the calibration antenna is not aligned at the centre of the set up during the calibration, then there will be uncertainty related to the measurement distance.\\nThe phase centre of a horn antenna moves with frequency along the taper length of the antenna therefore during the calibration the phase centre of all frequencies will not be aligned with the setup centre. The associated uncertainty term can be estimated using the following formula [14]:\\nGiven the above context, select the correct answer to the question from the multiple choice options below.

While some network slice services can be simultaneously provided to the UE, there can be network slices which cannot simultaneously provide services to the UE. This is because there are multiple related factors for a network slice, e.g., enterprise use vs personal use, isolation requirement, general public use vs public safety use, frequency limitation, location restriction, etc. \\n5.3.2\\tPre-conditions\\nNetwork slices are deployed by same geographical location but they are incompatible by configuration. Figure 5.3.2-1 shows the use case scenario where a RAN node connects to two network slices simultaneously. Slice M and Slice N have no shared/common core network nodes supporting these network slices due to network resources incompatibility in 5GC. For example, Slice M is used for public security and Slice N is used for Internet access. In the 5GC, dedicated network resources and network functionalities are separately customised for public security emergency service and video service to meet the isolation requirements, which ensures the independence of core network resources between different network slices. Accordingly, the two network slices are isolated and cannot be simultaneously provided to the UE. Figure 4.9.3.1-1: C-Plane connectivity of eNBs involved in Dual Connectivity\\n4.9.3.2\\tE-UTRAN User Plane for Dual Connectivity\\nFor dual connectivity two different user plane architectures are allowed: one in which the S1-U only terminates in the MeNB and the user plane data is transferred from MeNB to SeNB using the X2-U, and a second architecture where the S1-U can terminate in the SeNB. Figure 4.9.3.2-1 shows different U-plane connectivity options of eNBs involved in DC for a certain UE.\\nDifferent bearer options can be configured with different user plane architectures. U-plane connectivity depends on the bearer option configured:\\n-\\tFor MCG bearers, the S1-U connection for the corresponding bearer(s) to the S-GW is terminated in the MeNB. The SeNB is not involved in the transport of user plane data for this type of bearer(s) over the Uu.\\n-\\tFor split bearers, the S1-U connection to the S-GW is terminated in the MeNB. PDCP data is transferred between the MeNB and the SeNB via X2-U. The SeNB and MeNB are involved in transmitting data of this bearer type over the Uu.\\n-\\tFor SCG bearers, the SeNB is directly connected with the S-GW via S1-U. The MeNB is not involved in the transport of user plane data for this type of bearer(s) over the Uu.

The solution works as follows:\\n1.\\tDuring the PDU Session Establishment/Modification, the H-SMF provides via ePCO the UE with both the H-EASDF/H-DNS resolver's IP address (as per Rel-17) and the V-EASDF's IP address. In addition, the H-SMF may include a preference indication indicating which one of the two DNS resolvers the HPLMN would like the UE to use. If no preference indication is included, it means that the HPLMN does not have a preference.\\nNOTE\\xa01:\\tFor backward compatibility, if the H-SMF includes only one IP address in the ePCO (i.e. the one of the H-EASDF/-HDNS resolver), then the UE behaves as per Rel-17 (see EDC functionality in TS\\xa023.548\\xa0[3] clauses\\xa05.2.1 and 6.2.4). In that case the H-SMF will not include in the preference indication in the ePCO.\\nNOTE\\xa02:\\tAs described in Solution 25 in clause\\xa06.25, this assumes that the V-SMF provides the H-SMF with the IP address of the V-EASDF. The H-SMF can provide the V-SMF with the IP address of the H-EASDF/H-DNS resolver so that, if needed, it can be configured to forward potential unresolvable DNS queries.\\n2.\\tThe EDC functionality in the UE, once received the two addresses, takes the optional preference indication from the HPLMN into account and, based on local logic (e.g. whether a certain application can use Edge Computing services in the VPLMN, user preferences, etc.), selects to use either the H-EASDF/H-DNS resolver (as per Rel-17) or the V-EASDF to resolve a specific DNS query.\\n3.\\tDepending on the selected DNS resolver, the DNS query is sent to the HPLMN or to the VPLMN.\\n6.53.2\\tProcedures\\nFigure\\xa06.53.2-1 represents a simplified signalling flow for discovering the EAS in case of HR PDU Session with Session Breakout in the VPLMN.

The CTF determines whether the request corresponds to an event (event based charging) or whether a session shall be started (session based charging). Generally, this property is built into the network capability, or service, that the NE provides, and described in the middle tier TSs.\\n5.2.1.1\\tTransfer of charging events via Rf\\nIn event based charging, a network / user event (e.g. MM submission) corresponds to a single chargeable event. In session based charging, at least two chargeable events are needed, one each to describe the start and the end of the session, respectively. Multiple interim events are possible in order to describe changes to session characteristics (generally termed \"change of charging condition\", e.g. tariff time switch, change of PDP context QoS or change of IMS session media types), or when certain limits, e.g. time or volume, are exceeded. The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the CDF in real-time.\\nThe relation between chargeable events and charging events is 1:1. For event based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is 1:1. For session based charging, the relation between charging events and CDRs is m:n with m >=n. The middle tier TSs specify the chargeable events per domain / service / subsystem even if Rf does not exist as an open interface in the respective domain / service / subsystem, as it is always required to identify the connection between chargeable events and triggers for CDR generation and information addition.\\nIf charging events are generated for unsuccessful resource usage attempts, the charging event must describe the reason and the circumstances of the failure. Details, including if and when those events are generated, are specified in the middle tier TSs.\\nDetails on the protocol application for the open Rf interface, including the message types and the domain / subsystem /service independent contents of the messages, can be found in TS 32.299 [50].\\n5.2.1.2\\tTransfer of CDRs via Ga\\nUpon receiving a charging event, the CDF uses the event to create/open a CDR (both event and session based charging), or to add information to an existing open CDR. As there is a 1:1 mapping between charging events and CDRs in event based charging, CDRs are created promptly after receiving and processing the event, and are then ready for transfer on to the CGF via the Ga reference point.\\nIn session based charging, a CDR is opened when the initial charging event, specifying the start of a user session, is received. Information is added to the CDR upon receiving interim charging events. The CDR may be closed due to a number of reasons configured on the CDF or dependent on implementation, including but not limited to:\\n-\\ttime limit;\\n-\\tvolume limit;\\n-\\tlimit of change of charging conditions;\\n-\\tend of user session, e.g. reception of the final charging event describing the session termination;\\n-\\tlimits (e.g. memory size) imposed by implementation.\\nThe CDR generation could be suppressed to limit the number of CDRs based on operator configuration.\\nWhen a CDR is closed and the session is still active, a subsequent CDR is opened. Hence multiple \"partial CDRs\" may be needed to completely describe the session. This implies that opening and closure of CDRs may occur completely asynchronously to the reception of the charging events.\\nThe size of partial CDRs could be optionally reduced by allowing a reduced format for partial CDRs, implying that some information can be eliminated rather than repeated in all the partial CDRs. This means that only changes from one CDR to the next, in addition to mandatory information, is reported. All the missing information can be reconstructed from fields in previous partial CDRs. For example, if location information is captured in CDRs but the user did not change location, the corresponding partial CDR would not include any location information.\\nTherefore, two formats are considered for Partial CDRs:\\n-\\ta Fully Qualified Partial CDR that contains the complete set of CDR Fields, and\\n-\\ta Reduced Partial CDR that contains all the Mandatory fields (M) and ONLY the changes that occurred in any other field relative to the previous partial CDR.\\nThe first CDR generated when a session is opened shall be a Fully Qualified Partial CDR. Subsequent partial CDRs may be Reduced Partial CDRs. Thus, the convention is that when any non-mandatory field is missing from a Reduced Partial CDR, it should be interpreted that the same field as in the previous partial CDR could be used. Refer to clause 5.4 for the definition of \"mandatory\" and other CDR field categories.\\nAll CDFs and CGFs from all vendors shall be able to generate or receive Fully Qualified Partial CDRs. Generation and reception of Reduced Partial CDRs on the Ga interface is optional. However, if Reduced Partial CDRs are transmitted on the Ga interface they must comply with the rules specified in this clause.\\nIf the CDFs are generating Reduced Partial CDRs on the Ga interface, the CGF must be able to convert the CDRs into Fully Qualified Partial CDRs. However, if according to operator choice, the BD can support Reduced Partial CDRs, no conversion to the Fully Qualified Partial CDR format is required.\\nThe possible charging configurations that can be supported on both the Ga and the Bx interfaces are illustrated in figure\\xa05.2.1.2.1. Configuration a) is the default arrangement that MUST be supported by all systems. The other configurations are optional and may be supported IN ADDITION to configuration a). Configuration b) illustrates the case where the CGF is converting Reduced to Fully Qualified Partial CDRs. Configuration c) depicts the case were Reduced Partial CDRs can be received in the BD and no conversion is needed. Figure 4.3.2.0.1: Logical ubiquitous online charging architecture\\n4.3.2.1\\tCharging Trigger Function\\nAs outlined in clause 4.1.2, online charging is a process where charging information is collected in the network element in the same fashion as in offline charging. This implies that, from the functional perspective, the CTF defined in clause 4.3.1.1, also creates the charging events used for online charging. While the accounting metrics used in online charging are generally the same as in offline charging (i.e. the charging mechanism is transparent to the Accounting Metrics Collection), the following functional enhancements concerning the Accounting Data Forwarding are required in the CTF in order to support online charging:\\n-\\tThe information collected for, and included in, the online charging events is not necessarily identical to the offline charging case (i.e. the chargeable events may not necessarily be identical to those observed in offline charging);\\n-\\tThe charging events are forwarded to the Online Charging Function (OCF) in order to obtain authorisation for the chargeable event / network resource usage requested by the user;\\n-\\tThe CTF must be able to delay the actual resource usage until permission by the OCS has been granted;\\n-\\tThe CTF must be able to track the availability of resource usage permission (\"quota supervision\") during the network resource usage;\\n-\\tThe CTF must be able to enforce termination of the end user’s network resource usage when permission by the OCS is not granted or expires.\\nThe underlying principles for requesting, granting and managing resource usage permissions are described in detail in clause 5.1.\\nNote that the S-CSCF, although involved in online charging, does not create any online charging events, therefore clauses 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2 are not completely applicable to the S-CSCF. Clause 4.3.2.2.2 describes online charging specifically for the S-CSCF.\\nThe charging events for online charging are transferred to the OCS using the CAP or Ro reference points. Refer to figure 4.2.1 for information on the applicability of CAP or Ro per NE type. 4.3.2.2\\tOnline Charging System\\n4.3.2.2.0\\tGeneral\\nThe following sub-clauses summarise the tasks of the functions comprising the OCS. Details of the OCS, and the role of each of its functional components, are described in TS 32.296 [53].\\n4.3.2.2.1\\tOnline Charging Function\\nThe OCF consists of two distinct modules, namely the Session Based Charging Function (SBCF) and the Event Based Charging Function (EBCF).\\nThe Session Based Charging Function is responsible for online charging of network / user sessions, e.g. voice calls, IP CAN bearers, IP CAN session or IMS sessions. \\nThe Event Based Charging Function performs event-based online charging (also referred to as \"content charging\") in conjunction with any application server or service NE, including SIP application servers.\\nOnline charging in the CS and PS domains may be performed using the CAP reference point from the MSC and SGSN, respectively, to the OCF (refer to TS 23.078 [207] for details on CAP). Online charging communication between the S-CSCF and the SBCF is described in clause 4.3.2.2.2. All other network elements employ the Ro reference point for online charging (refer to TS 32.299 [50]). Refer to TS 32.296 [53] for details on the relation between the network elements (i.e. the embedded online enhanced CTF) and the SBCF or EBCF, respectively.\\n4.3.2.2.2\\tS-CSCF online charging / IMS Gateway Function\\nAs stated above, the S-CSCF does not trigger any online charging events and thus does not include the CTF online charging enhancements described in clause 4.3.2.1 (in contrast, it does have a CTF for offline charging, as described in clause 4.3.1.1). Instead, the ISC interface is employed by the S-CSCF online charging, implying that online charging is transparent to the S-CSCF and appears like any other service logic controlled by a SIP application server. Therefore, if support for Ro based online charging is required instead of / or in addition to application server or MRFC, a special CTF is needed in order to mediate between the Ro based SBCF and the SIP based service control. This role is taken by the IMS Gateway Function (IMS GWF), which translates between SIP service control towards the S-CSCF and Ro Credit-Control on the OCS side.\\nFrom the perspective of the online charging architecture, the IMS GWF is an online charging capable CTF; from the perspective of the S-CSCF, the IMS GWF is a SIP application server and is triggered the same way. It is out of scope of the 3GPP standards whether the IMS GWF is embedded in the S-CSCF, embedded in the OCS/SBCF, or exists as a stand-alone component.\\n4.3.2.2.3\\tRating Function\\nThe Rating Function (RF) determines the value of the network resource usage (described in the charging event received by the OCF from the network) on behalf of the OCF. To this end, the OCF furnishes the necessary information, obtained from the charging event, to the RF and receives in return the rating output (monetary or non-monetary units), via the Re reference point. The RF may handle a wide variety of rateable instances, such as:\\n-\\tRating of data volume (e.g. based on charging initiated by an access network entity, i.e. on the bearer level);\\n-\\tRating of session / connection time (e.g. based on charging initiated by a SIP application, i.e. on the subsystem level);\\n-\\tRating of service events (e.g. based on charging of web content or MMS, i.e. on the service level).\\n4.3.2.2.4\\tAccount Balance Management Function\\nThe Account Balance Management Function (ABMF) is the location of the subscriber’s account balance within the OCS or the CCS. The ABMF is put into functional context within TS 32.296 [53].\\n4.3.2.3\\tCDR generation for online charged subscribers\\nIn offline charging, CDRs are generated in the network and forwarded to the BD for further processing, e.g. generating subscriber bills. In online charging, network resource usage is granted by the OCS based on a subscriber account on the OCS. If required by the operator, CDRs may additionally be generated for online charged subscribers. One way of achieving this is by performing online charging and offline charging simultaneously for these subscribers. Alternatively, the OCS can accomplish this by the use of the appropriate offline charging functions as follows:\\n-\\tA CDF, as specified in clause 4.3.1.2, is employed by each of the OCFs that are required to generate CDRs from the charging events they receive from the CTF;\\n-\\tA CGF, as specified in clause 4.3.1.3, is employed by the OCS in order to generate / manage CDR files and provide these files to the BD.\\n4.3.3\\tConverged charging functions\\n4.3.3.0\\tGeneral\\nFigure 4.3.3.0.1 provides an overview of converged charging architecture. The figure 4.3.3.0.1 depicts the logical charging functions in the network and interface between these functions and to the BD. \\nThis charging architecture is used for 5G system. 5.2\\tMMS offline charging scenarios\\n5.2.1\\tBasic principles\\nMMS offline charging implies the generation of CDRs of various types by the involved MMS R/S(s). As explained in clause 5.1, only event based charging applies to MMS, i.e. there is no use of session based charging in the MMS R/S. \\nIn line with the principles for event based charging laid down in TS 32.240 [1], the relationship between chargeable events and charging events is 1:1, and the relationship between charging events and CDRs is also 1:1.\\nThe chargeable event triggers are defined in clause 5.1.1 to 5.1.4 above and are identified by the labels within the figures 5.1 to 5.4 (message flows) in relation to the particular MMS reference point. As can be seen from these figures, the chargeable events relate to transactions at the MM1, MM4 and MM7 reference points.\\nAn open Rf or Ga interface is not specified for MMS in the 3GPP standards, hence no charging events (Rf message flows) are specified in clause 5.2.2. \\nIn clause 5.2.3, CDR generation is described in relation to the chargeable event triggers specified in clause 5.1, given that there is a 1:1 relation all the way from chargeable event to CDR type as explained in the first paragraph above. However, due to the absence of a standard Ga interface for MMS, from the 3GPP specifications perspective these CDRs are only visible in CDR files crossing the Bm interface.\\n5.2.2\\tRf message flows\\nNot applicable, as the separation of the CTF and CDF is not in the scope of the MMS charging standards. \\nRefer to clause 4.2 for further information.\\nNOTE: \\tVendors may nevertheless implement a separate CTF and CDF for MMS charging. \\nIn this case, it is recommended that the approach chosen conforms to the principles and protocol applications specified in TS 32.299 [50].\\n5.2.3\\tCDR generation\\nFor MMS, the Ga interface is not applicable, as the separation of the CDF and CGF is not in the scope of the MMS charging specifications. I.e. the following CDR types are visible only in the CDR files transferred from the MMS R/S embedded CGF to the BD via the Bm interface. \\nNOTE: \\tIf vendors choose to implement the Ga interface for MMS, then it is recommended that the approach chosen conforms with the CDRs specified in this section and the Ga protocol conventions laid down in \\nTS 32.295 [54].\\n5.2.3.1\\tCombined Originator and Recipient MMS R/S case\\nThe chargeable events for the case of a combined Originator and Recipient MMS R/S are depicted in figure 5.1.1.1 and further listed in table 5.1.1.1. Due to the fact that only event based charging applies to MMS (see clause 5.2.1), these chargeable events translate 1:1 into the CDR types listed in table 5.2.3.1.1 below.\\nThe first row in table 5.2.3.1.1 refers to the trigger labels in figure/table 5.1.1.1. \\nThe second row identifies the associated CDR type. The content of these CDR types is specified in clause 6.\\nTable 5.2.3.1.1: Record type overview for combined MMS R/S For converged charging, the following details of chargeable events and corresponding actions in the IMS nodes are defined in Table 5.4.3.2:\\nTable 5.4.3.2: Chargeable events and their related actions in IMS nodes\\nGiven the above context, select the correct answer to the question from the multiple choice options below. Use only the option number (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) as your answer.\\nQuestion: In online charging, how are chargeable events transformed into charging events?\\nOptions:\\n1. By the CTF\\n2. By the OCF\\n3. By the CGF\\n4. By the CHF\\n\\nAnswer:']\n"]},{"output_type":"error","ename":"OutOfMemoryError","evalue":"CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 4.23 GiB.
