This is in line with the requirements of two major regulatory bodies and summarized as follows:\\nTable A.1-1: Accuracy requirements for emergency calls Figure 7.6-1: Handling of location information in IMS emergency calls\\n1.\\tThe user initiates an emergency call.\\n2.\\tThe UE determines its own location or location identifier if possible. If the UE is not able to determine its own location, the UE may, if capable, request its location information from the IP-CAN, if that is supported for the used IP-CAN. If applicable, the IP-CAN delivers to the UE the UE's geographical location information and/or the location identifier.\\n3.\\tThe UE sends an INVITE with an emergency indication to the IMS core. The INVITE should contain any location information that the terminal has. The location information may be geographical location information or a location identifier, which is dependent upon the access network technology. If the UE is not able to provide any location information, the IMS core may seek to determine the UE's location from the LRF as described below. The INVITE may optionally contain information concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE.\\nNOTE:\\tThe location solutions and position methods conveyed in the INVITE and the means of inclusion in the INVITE are outside the scope of this specification.\\n4.\\tIf the location information provided in step\\u00a03 is trusted and sufficient to determine the correct PSAP, the procedure continues from step 7 onwards. If the location information is insufficient or if the IMS core requires emergency routing information, or if the IMS core is required to validate the location information, or if the IMS core is required to map the location identifier received from the UE into the corresponding geographical location information, the IMS core sends a location request to the LRF. The request shall include information identifying the IP-CAN and the UE and may include means to access the UE (e.g. UE's IP address). The request shall also include any location information provided by the UE in step 2. The request may optionally include any information concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE.\\n5.\\tThe LRF may already have the information requested by IMS core or LRF may request the UE's location information.\\n5a.\\tThe means to obtain the location information may differ depending on the access technology the UE is using to access the IMS. The SUPL procedures defined in OMA AD SUPL: \\\"Secure User Plane Location Architecture\\\" [15], OMA TS ULP: \\\"User Plane Location Protocol\\\" [16], may be used if supported by the terminal and if it is possible to establish a user plane connection between the UE and the SUPL server. Information provided in step 4 concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE may optionally be used by the LRF to help determine the means to obtain the location information.\\n5b.\\tIf configured to provide an NPLI for WLAN access, and if the UE is not roaming, the LRF queries HSS for every access the LRF is configured for. The LRF issues a separate query for every access. If the LRF cannot obtain an NPLI, it shall invoke procedure 5a.\\n\\tThe LRF may invoke an RDF to convert the location information received in step\\u00a04 or obtained in step\\u00a05a into PSAP routing information, but LRF's interactions with RDF are out of scope of the present specification. The LRF may store the location information, but only for a defined limited time in certain regions, according to regional requirements.\\n6.\\tThe LRF sends the location information and/or the routing information to the IMS core. The LRF may also return correlation information (e.g. ESQK) identifying itself and any record stored in step\\u00a05a.\\n7.\\tThe IMS core uses the routing information provided in step\\u00a06 or selects an emergency centre or PSAP based on location information provided in step\\u00a03 or 6 and sends the request including the location information and any correlation information and possibly location information source, e.g., positioning method that was used to obtain the location information to the emergency centre or PSAP.\\n7a.\\tThe INVITE is sent to an MGCF/MGW;\\n7b.\\tThe IAM is continued towards the emergency centre or PSAP; or\\n7c.\\tThe INVITE is sent directly to the emergency centre or PSAP.\\n8.\\tThe emergency call establishment is completed.\\n9.\\tThe PSAP may send a location request to the LRF to get the initial location information for the target UE, or to request LRF to get updated, i.e. current, location information for the target UE. The PSAP may determine the LRF based on the location and/or correlation information received in step\\u00a07. The PSAP may also include the correlation information in the request to the LRF.\\n10.\\tDepending on the access type, UE location is determined as follows:\\n10a.\\tFor non WLAN-access and optionally for WLAN access, the LRF determines the target UE's location using one of the means listed in step 5a above. The LRF may use the correlation information received in step\\u00a09 to retrieve information about the UE that was stored in step\\u00a05a.\\n10b.\\tFor WLAN access, the LRF may use the correlation information received in step\\u00a06 to send a request to the IMS core to retrieve a UPLI from the UE. The IMS core uses the emergency call signalling channel for that purpose. Steps 10b1 to 10b4 depict this procedure. If UPLI is not available when the request comes to the UE (e.g. due to insufficient time), and UPLI cannot be returned, the UE may also provide UPLI once, when available by executing step\\u00a010b3 following step\\u00a08.\\n10c.\\tFor WLAN access, and if the LRF is configured to provide an NPLI for WLAN access, and if the UE is not roaming, the LRF queries HSS for every access the LRF is configured for. The LRF issues a separate query for every access. If the LRF cannot obtain an NPLI, it shall invoke procedure 10a.\\n11.\\tThe LRF returns the initial or updated location information to the emergency centre or PSAP. As an option for initial location, the LRF may instigate the location step\\u00a010a before the request in step\\u00a09 is received and may send the initial location to the emergency centre or PSAP either after the request in step\\u00a09 is received or before it is received.\\n12.\\tThe emergency call is released.\\n13.\\tThe IMS core may indicate to the LRF that the call is released. The LRF deletes any record stored in step\\u00a05a.\\n7.6.2\\tVoid NOTE\\u00a01:\\tIt is not possible for a UE to indicate more than one type of emergency service in an emergency service URN.\\nIf:\\n-\\tthe UE considers itself in the country of the HPLMN;\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tIt is out of scope of the present annex to define how the UE determines whether it considered itself in the country of the HPLMN.

Step\\u00a02 to 6 may be skipped based on the conditions specified in clause\\u00a06.1.\\n2.\\tIn the case that the UE has insufficient resources or capabilities to establish an emergency call due to other ongoing sessions then the UE should terminate the ongoing communication and release reserved bearer resources.\\n3.\\tIn the case that bearer registration is required and has not been performed, the UE shall perform bearer registration to the IP-CAN.

The IP-CAN may support a UE indication that this request is for an emergency service.\\nIf the IP-CAN does not provide an IP address to the UE in step 3, then the IP-CAN shall allocate an IP address to the UE during the bearer resource request procedures.\\n5.\\tUE performs a P-CSCF discovery procedure, where the UE discovers a P-CSCF in the local network suitable for use in emergency sessions.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tThe exact means for the P-CSCF discovery is dependent upon the IP-CAN.\\n6.\\tIf the UE has sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS network, it shall initiate an IMS emergency registration by providing the IP address obtained at step 3 or step 4 to the P-CSCF selected at step 5. The IP address used for signalling purposes is allocated in association with step 3 or step 4. The IMS registration request shall include an emergency indication. The implicit registration set of the SIP URI used in the emergency registration request used by the UE when the UE performs a non-emergency registration shall contain an associated TEL-URI that is used to call back the UE.\\n\\tThe S-CSCF may set the proposed registration expiration according to the local regulation or operator policy of the serving system. The subsequent registration flows are like any other registration with the considerations defined in clauses 6.2.4 and 6.2.9.\\n\\tIf the UE does not have sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS network, it shall not initiate an IMS emergency registration request, but instead immediately establish an emergency session towards the P-CSCF as described in clause\\u00a07.4 and skip step\\u00a07.\\n7.\\tThe UE shall initiate the IMS emergency session establishment using the IMS session establishment procedures containing an emergency service indication, or the eCall type of emergency service indication in the case of eCall and any registered Public User Identifier. If the UE has performed emergency registration, the UE shall use an emergency registered Public User Identifier.\\nWhether the procedures are activated individually by the UE or some of them are performed automatically depends on the implementation of the terminal and on the UE's configuration. For instance, the multimedia application in the UE could start the application level registration and steps 2-4 would have to be executed in response to support the operation initiated by the application. Interaction with the UE may happen during these steps.\\n7.1.2\\tNon UE detectable Emergency Session\\nAs the UE could not detect the emergency session, the session establishment request will be sent to a P-CSCF in the visited PLMN or a P-CSCF in the home PLMN as per a normal session establishment procedure. The former is only applicable to a roaming situation whereas the latter can apply to both a roaming and non-roaming situation and for the case of SNPN. Prior to sending the session establishment request the UE must be registered in the IMS as per the normal registration procedure.\\nIn the case that the P-CSCF detects that this is a request to establish an emergency session, based upon operator policy (e.g., checking access type):\\n-\\tthe P-CSCF may reject the session initiation request with an indication that this is for an emergency session.

The P-CSCF in the visited PLMN forwards that request to an Emergency CSCF in the same network. The P-CSCF in the home PLMN for a non-roaming UE may forward that request to a Serving CSCF or to an Emergency CSCF in the same network, based on local regulation or operator policy. The E-CSCF shall inform the UE that the session has been marked as an emergency session so the UE can treat the session as an emergency session establishment.\\n-\\tFor the case when a SNPN uses IMS services provided by an independent IMS provider, the P-CSCF is located in the IMS provider network according to TS\\u00a023.228\\u00a0[1], Annex\\u00a0A.\\nIf the AS detects that this is a request to establish an emergency session, the AS shall handle the request as specified in clause\\u00a06.2.8 and forward the request marked as an emergency services request to the S-CSCF.\\n7.1.3\\tEmergency Session Establishment using LRF/RDF\\nFigure 7.2 illustrates a high level call flow for the IMS emergency session establishment procedure using LRF/RDF to retrieve location and routing information. 13\\tSecurity aspects of emergency call handling \\n13.1\\tGeneral\\nNOTE:\\tSupport for EPS emergency calling is defined in the TS\\u00a023.402 [5]. Per TS\\u00a023.402 [5], this release of this specification is limited to support of handover of emergency sessions from E-UTRAN access to HRPD access only. In this release of this specification, handover of IMS Emergency Sessions from HRPD access to E-UTRAN access is not supported.\\n\\tSupport for IMS Emergency sessions over an WLAN access is supported as specified in subclause 4.5.7.2 of TS 23.402[5].

E-UTRAN provides an indication to HRPD access whether the UE has been authenticated in E-UTRAN or not, as described in TS 23.402 [5]. \\n13.3\\tUnauthenticated emergency calls over untrusted WLAN\",\n          \"A.2.2\\tFactory automation\\nA.2.2.1\\tMotion control\\nA motion control system is responsible for controlling moving and/or rotating parts of machines in a well-defined manner, for example in printing machines, machine tools or packaging machines.\\nA schematic representation of a motion control system is depicted in Figure A.2.2.1-1. A motion controller periodically sends desired set points to one or several actuators (e.g., a linear actuator or a drive) which thereupon perform a corresponding action on one or several processes (in this case usually a movement or rotation of a certain component). At the same time, sensors determine the current state of the process(es), e.g. the current position and/or rotation of one or multiple components, and send the actual values back to the motion controller. This is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner, such that during one application cycle the motion controller sends updated set points to all actuators, and all sensors send their actual values back to the motion controller. Nowadays, typically Industrial Ethernet technologies are used for motion control systems. Figure 5.2.2.4-1: Identifying and triggering automation capabilities among\\nmultiple network automation functions\\nTo Orchestrate the decisions of AI/ML network automation functions, e.g. AI/ML inference functions or ML entities (see figure 5.2.2.4-2):\\n-\\tEach network automation function generates a recommendation which it proposes to the AIMLOrchestration for implementation. The AIMLOrchestration takes recommendations for changes from the network automation functions and takes a decision whether to implement the policy changes or not. The policy changes may be stated by the network automation functions as hash functions of parameter to parameter-values annotated with the time within which the values should be activated or else be discarded.\\n-\\tThe AIMLOrchestration undertake control tasks for the recommended and approved configuration changes, e.g. concurrency control, to ensure that their action will not conflict with other ongoing or proposed actions. In case of conflicts the AIMLOrchestration may choose to schedule the action to a different time from when it is proposed.\\n-\\tAt the right time, the AIMLOrchestration implements the action onto the network and subsequently manages the coordination. Use case one\\nTo keep a plant running, it is essential that the assets, such as pumps, valves, heaters, and instruments are maintained. Timely recognition of any degradation and continuous self-diagnosis of components are used to support and plan maintenance. Remote software updates enhance and adapt the components to changing conditions and advances in technology. \\nA.2.4\\tHuman machine interfaces\\nA.2.4.1\\tMobile control panels\\nControl panels are crucial devices for the interaction between people and production machinery as well as for the interaction with moving devices. These panels are mainly used for configuring, monitoring, debugging, controlling and maintaining machines, robots, cranes or complete production lines. In addition to that, (safety) control panels are typically equipped with an emergency stop button and an enabling device, which an operator can use in case of a safety event in order to avoid damage to humans or machinery. When the emergency stop button is pushed, the controlled equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary position. Likewise, if a machine, robot, etc. is operated in the so-called special \\u2018enabling device mode\\u2019, the operator manually keeps the enabling device switch in a special stationary position. If the operator pushes this switch too much or releases it, the controlled equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary position as well. This way, it can be ensured that the hand(s) of the operator are on the panel (and not under a moulding press, for example), and that the operator does\\u2015for instance\\u2015not suffer from any electric shock or the like. A common use case for this \\u2018enabling device mode\\u2019 is the installation, testing or maintenance of a machine, during which other safety mechanisms (such as a safety fence) are deactivated.\\nDue to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory. With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly. This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines. \\nThe cycle times of the control application depends on the process/machinery/equipment whose safety has to be ensured. For a fast-moving robot, for example, end-to-end latencies are lower than for slowly moving linear actuators. \\nTable A.2.4.1-1: Service performance requirements for mobile control panels NOTE:\\tBlue objects: communication system; other objects: automation application system.\\nFigure\\u00a0C.1.1-1: Abstract diagram of the area of consideration for industrial radio communication \\nHere, a distributed automation application system is depicted. This system includes a distributed automation application, which is the aggregation of several automation functions. These can be functions in sensors, measurement devices, drives, switches, I/O devices, encoders etc. All of these functions contribute toward the control of physical objects. Field bus systems, industrial Ethernet systems, or wireless communication systems can be used for connecting the distributed functions. The essential function of these communication systems is the distribution of messages among the distributed automation functions. For cyber-physical control applications, the dependability of the entire communication system and/or of its devices or its links is essential. Communication functions are realised by the respective hardware and software implementation.\\nIn order for the automation application system to operate, messages need to be exchanged between spatially distributed application functions. For that process, messages are exchanged at an interface between the automation application system and the communication system. This interface is termed the reference interface. Required and guaranteed values for characteristic parameters, which describe the behavioural properties of the radio communication system, as well as some influence quantities refer to that interface.\\nThe conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g., end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system (e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath propagation). \\nGeneral requirements from the application point of view for the time and failure behaviour of a communication system are mostly related to an end-to-end link. It is assumed in the present document that the behaviour of the link is representative of the communication system as a whole and of the entire scope of the application. \\nC.1.2\\tLogical link\\nC.1.2.1\\tNature and function\\nStarting with the general approach mentioned in Subclause C.1.1, the logical link can be regarded as a possible asset within the area of consideration (see Figure\\u00a0C.1.1-1). The conditions under which its functions are to be performed are vital for the dependability of the automation application system. Figure 5.2.2.4-2: Orchestrating the decision among multiple network automation functions\\nTo share knowledge and coordinate the impacts executed decisions of AI/ML network automation functions, e.g. AI/ML inference functions or ML entities (see figure 5.2.2.4-3):\\n-\\tThe AIMLOrchestration is a meta-learning agent responsible for learning if any of the availed network automation functions is behaving outside its expected region and for taking the accordingly appropriate counter-measures. So, for the activated configuration changes, the AIMLOrchestration manages the transaction among network automation functions that are intended to coordinate their actions and executions.\\n-\\tFollowing the execution of changes, the AIMLOrchestration triggers the other network automation functions (besides the one requesting the change) to start a monitoring period to identify any negative effects on their metrics.\\n-\\tAt the end of the observation period the network automation functions evaluate the effects of the changes and report to the AIMLOrchestration their network (metric) status observations in form of Action Quality Indicators. The network automation functions consume performance assurance (PM), fault supervision (FM) and provisioning (CM) services on their respective network elements and domains to evaluate the effect of the executed policy changes or configurations.\\n-\\tThe network automation functions report the observed effects in terms of the Action Quality Indicators to the AIMLOrchestration for aggregation. Note that, in a distributed implementation of the coordination, the Action Quality Indicators may also be reported directly to the network automation function which generated the action that was executed.\\n-\\tIn the subsequent AQI handling, the AIMLOrchestration evaluates the network status inputs from the multiple network automation functions and network domains to learn the effects of the configuration changes, i.e. the AIMLOrchestration determines if the effects are acceptable or not.\\n-\\tWhere a given change is determined to be out of the expected range, such a change needs to be labelled accordingly. For example, the change may be barred from ever being re-applied or from being reused in the specific context.\\n-\\tThe AIMLOrchestration informs the respective network automation function of the evaluation outcome (e.g. by sending the aggregate AQI). The AIMLOrchestration also accordingly re-configures the network automation functions, when necessary, e.g. by changing the network automation function's applicable control parameter spaces or its performance targets.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"merged_prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1460,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Context:\\nFigure 6.30.2-1: Processing AF requests to influence traffic routing for Sessions not identified by an UE address\\n-\\tIn step 1, the target of the AF request may refer a set of UEs as described in clause\\u00a06.30.1.\\n-\\tIn step 3 and 4, the data stored in UDR and the information sent to the PCF may refer to one of \\\"Allowed services\\\" and/or \\\"Subscriber categories\\\" as defined in TS\\u00a023.503\\u00a0[13] table\\u00a06.2-2.\\nClause\\u00a04.3.6.2 of TS\\u00a023.502\\u00a0[9] \\\"SM Policy Association Establishment\\\" is modified as follows: Figure 6.43.2.1-1: Procedure for FL member selection\\n1.\\tThe AF retrieves the user consent subscription data, indicating whether the network is allowed to expose UE related 5GC information, for the UEs in the candidate list from the UDM (via NEF if AF is untrusted) by invoking Nudm_SDM_Get service operation.\\n2.\\t[Optional]The AF requests the location reporting of the UEs from the AMF (via NEF if AF is untrusted) by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Location Reporting).\\n\\tThe AF should maintain the candidate UE list itself before FL member selection, and include the Target UE Identifier(s) for the UEs in the candidate list in the request as described in clause\\u00a05.6.7 of TS\\u00a023.501\\u00a0[3], which is same for step\\u00a02 and step\\u00a03.\\n3.\\tThe AF initiates direct notification of Qos Monitoring procedure for delay information for the UEs in the candidate list, as defined in steps 1a-5 of clause\\u00a06.4.2.1 of TS\\u00a023.548\\u00a0[10].\\n4.\\tThe AF requests user plane information, e.g. Throughput UL/DL, Packet transmission, Packet retransmission, for the UEs in the candidate list from UPF.\\nNOTE\\u00a01:\\tHow to collect data from UPF will depend on the outcome of FS-UPEAS SID.\\n5.\\tThe AF selects FL members based on user consent subscription data from UDM, UE location from AMF, and delay and packet drop information reporting from UPF.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tAF may keep monitoring the information from AMF/UPF/UDM to update FL members.\\n6.43.3\\tImpacts on services, entities and interfaces\\nAF:\\n-\\tSupporting user consent subscription data collection from UDM.\\n-\\tSupporting FL member selection based on the information from AMF, UDM and UPF.\\nUDM:\\n-\\tSupporting user consent information of whether the network is allowed to expose UE related 5GC information.\\nUPF:\\n-\\tSupporting to report user plane information to AF.\\n6.44\\tSolution #44: 5G assisted FL member selection for application request\\n6.44.1\\tDescription\\nThis solution is applied to KI#7: 5GS Assistance to Federated Learning Operation.\\nThis solution supports AF sends request to 5GS for a list of UEs with one or multiple restriction criterial, for example:\\n-\\tUEs in Connected state.\\n-\\tUEs in different location information.\\n-\\tUE QoS monitoring threshold.\\n-\\tService Experience threshold.\\nThe AIML function maybe co-located with NEF or deployed standalone and used for external exposure to assist 5G AIML service.

By this EDI is updated with EAS address field per DNAI and an indicator if the DNAI is selected for a group. The data in EDI is also updated with a Dynamic External Group Id that can be per DNAI or per application ID. The AF can use the Dynamic External Group ID and external application id to influence routing for a collection of UEs. The dynamic external group id is an identifier that is generated by the AF, i.e. it is not to be confused with the external group id configured in UDM. The AF associates a list of UEs with the dynamic external group id when requesting in AF influence on routing that the list of UEs should be using the same EAS and/or DNAI.\\nExample of EDI record before any group has been requested through traffic influence:\\nDNN-1/S-NSSAI-1:\\n\\tApplicationID-1\\n\\tFQDN\\n\\tDynExtGrID-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-2\\n\\tDNAI-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-4 \\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tDNAI-2\\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tetc.\\nExample of EDI record before after some groups have been requested through traffic influence:\\nDNN-1/S-NSSAI-1:\\n\\tApplicationID-1\\n\\tFQDN\\n\\tDynExtGrID-1\\n\\tDNAI-55\\n\\tEASaddr-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-2\\n\\tDNAI-1\\n\\tDynExtGrID-4\\n\\tDNAI selection indicator\\n\\tEASaddr-3\\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tDNAI-2\\n\\tDynExtGrID-5\\n\\tEASaddr-2\\n6.34.2\\tProcedure\\nThe following is the procedure for selecting the same EAS for collection of UEs accessing the same application.

Use only the option number (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) as your answer.\\nQuestion: Which entity is responsible for providing the Candidate-UE filtering policy to the AF?\\nOptions:\\n1. AMF\\n2. UPF\\n3. eNEF\\n4. SMF\\n5. AF\\n\\nAnswer:\",\n          \"Context:\\nFigure B.2.1.4-1: Cascade of components\\n\\nThe combined mismatch uncertainty is given by the root sum square of the individual contributions:\\n\\nIn an optimized test procedure, the overall mismatch uncertainty is smaller when matching pairs of mismatches exist in the calibration and measurement stage since these pairs cancel each other out. Figure B.2.1.4-2 displays a calibration setup, where device D is replaced by device F. The mismatch contributions for this path are AB, BC, CE, ABC, BCE and ABCE. For a result based on the measurement and calibration stage, the mismatch contributions AB, BC, and ABC are matching pairs as they occur both in the measurement and calibration stage. Thus, they can be eliminated [11], and the system mismatch uncertainty is obtained as \\n\\nFigure B.2.1.4-2: Sketch of a calibration path Figure B.2.1.10-1: Calibration Setup Figure A-1. Example of ranging accuracy\\nAnnex B:\\nConsideration for reference of measurement\\nTo represent an object in some coordinates, it is important to set appropriate origin and reference axis, and for all parties to have same understanding of these. Table B.2.1.4-1: comprises the reflection and transmission properties of the components of the example path at a frequency of 43.5 GHz\\n\\nThe calculation of the overall mismatch uncertainty for a frequency of 43.5 GHz results in a value of 2.7 dB for the standard deviation, i.e., the expanded uncertainty is 5.3 dB.\\nFigure B.2.1.4-4 depicts a possible calibration for a part of the setup.\\n\\nFigure B.2.1.4-4: Block Diagram of the calibration stage B.2.1.11\\tInsertion loss Variation\\nThis uncertainty contribution comes from introducing an additional cable which is not present for both the calibration and DUT measurement. If the cables remain the same for the calibration and DUT measurement, then the contribution should be set to zero.\\nIf an additional cable is added for one part of the test, the insertion loss must be accounted for in the measurement results. If the insertion loss is measured the uncertainty contribution will be the combined uncertainty related to the insertion loss measurement. The insertion loss can also be taken from the datasheet and assumed to have a rectangular distribution.\\nB.2.1.12\\tRF leakage (from measurement antenna to receiver/transmitter)\\nThis contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between measurement antenna and receiving/transmitting equipment. The contribution also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between reference antenna and transmitting equipment for the calibration phase. This uncertainty contributor is contained in the contributor quality of quiet zone described in clause B.2.1.3 and its value therefore is set to zero.\\nB.2.1.13\\tMisalignment of positioning System\\nThis contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn table angle/tilt accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to the beam peak this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.\\nB.2.1.14\\tUncertainty of the Network Analyzer\\nThis contribution originates from all uncertainties involved transmission magnitude measurement with a network analyser, for example: drift, frequency flatness, temperature variation from kit calibration to path losses measurement as well as interpolation of calibration data if test frequencies were not calibrated during path loss characterization. The uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer's data sheet. It needs to be ensured that appropriate manufacturer's uncertainty contribution is specified for the absolute levels measured.\\nWhen an end-to-end system calibration approach is used, the absolute levels are related to the total system losses of the measurement path. When a split calibration approach is used, separate MU contributions need to be determined\\n-\\tu_cond: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the conducted portion of the calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system losses for the portion of the system calibrated \\n-\\tu_rad: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the radiated portion of the calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system losses for the portion of the system calibrated\\nThe total MU of the network analyser for the split calibration is the RSS\\u2019ed value of u_cond and u_rad.\\nB.2.1.15\\tUncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna\\nThe calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the gain uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty will come from a calibration report with traceability to a National Metrology Institute with measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the guidelines outlined in internationally accepted standards.\\nB.2.1.16\\tPositioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna and the measurement antenna\\nThis contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the reference antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.\\nB.2.1.17\\tgNB emulator uncertainty\\ngNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via multiple external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and  a circulator, etc.) in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level. Receiving device used is typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA. Generally there occurs uncertainty contribution from absolute level accuracy, non-linearity and frequency characteristic of the gNB emulator.\\nFor practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as calibration equipment, gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on the absolute level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be assumed as systematic. This uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer\\u2019s data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is included in the absolute level uncertainty.\\nB.2.1.18\\tPhase centre offset of calibration\\nGain is defined at the phase centre of the antenna. If the phase centre of the calibration antenna is not aligned at the centre of the set up during the calibration, then there will be uncertainty related to the measurement distance.\\nThe phase centre of a horn antenna moves with frequency along the taper length of the antenna therefore during the calibration the phase centre of all frequencies will not be aligned with the setup centre. The associated uncertainty term can be estimated using the following formula [14]:\\nGiven the above context, select the correct answer to the question from the multiple choice options below. Use only the option number (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) as your answer.\\nQuestion: Which of the following is not a feature that can be calibrated?\\nOptions:\\n1. Oxygen absorption\\n2.

It is composed of the following functional entities:\\n-\\tfor signalling control, a local inbound / outbound proxy as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.3.1.3.2, a registrar finder as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.3.1.3.3 and a registrar / application service selection entity as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.3.1.3.4.\\n9.2.1.4\\tEPS\\nThe EPS provides point-to-point and point-to-multipoint bearer services with QoS.\\n9.2.1.5\\tUE 1\\nUE 1 is:\\n-\\tan MC service UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services and application(s) related to one or more MC service;\\n-\\tan MC service UE that acts as ProSe UE-to-network relay; or\\n-\\tboth of the above.\\nWhen acting as an MC service UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services and application(s) related to one or more MC services, UE 1 is composed of the same functional entities as for UE 2, as described in subclause\\u00a09.2.1.6, without the support of ProSe capabilities.\\n9.2.1.6\\tUE 2\\nUE 2 is a device using ProSe UE-to-network relay, and supporting application(s) related to one or more MC services. It is composed of the following functional entities:\\n-\\tfor common services, a group management client as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.2.2.3, a configuration management client as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.2.2.1, an identity management client as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.2.2.5 and a key management client as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.2.2.7;\\n-\\tfor MC services, MC service clients as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.2.3.1 with relevant application functions of the corresponding MC service defined in the corresponding MC service TS; and\\n-\\tfor signalling control, a signalling user agent as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.3.1.1 and an HTTP client as described in subclause\\u00a07.4.3.3.1.\\n9.2.2\\tDeployment scenarios\\n9.2.2.1\\tAdministration of MC service, SIP core and EPS \\n9.2.2.1.1\\tGeneral\\nThis subclause describes five different deployment scenarios in which different administration of MC service, SIP core and EPS are described, together with the sensitivities of identities and other forms of signalling in those scenarios.\\nIn each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be different from the organisation that administers these devices. For example, the MC service provider may own some RAN components within the EPS even when the EPS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MC service UE may be owned by an organisation that is independent from PLMN and MC service providers.\\n9.2.2.1.2\\tCommon administration of all planes\\nIn this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and EPS) are administered by the same party. This is illustrated in figure\\u00a09.2.2.1.2-1 below. The main objective of the MCImp-MC_ARCH work item is to specify a common functional architecture for all mission critical services to support on-network and off-network operations. This common functional architecture includes the common services core functions and certain generic mechanisms (e.g. affiliation) for MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData services to be uniformly developed. This work item enables the re-use of the common services by other mission critical services not limited only to MCPTT.\\n\\nThe common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.

The MC ID is the identity that an MC service user presents to the identity management server during a user authentication transaction. In general, since identity management is a common service it uses an identity which is linked to a set of credentials (e.g. biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not necessarily be tied to a single mission critical service. The MC ID and the MC service ID may be the same. The MC ID uniquely identifies the MC service user to the identity management server. The MC ID is used by the identity management server to provide the identity management client a means for mission critical service authentication. \\nNOTE:\\tThe specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to use the MC user identity is specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a033.180 [25].\\n8.1.2\\tMC service user identity (MC service ID)\\nThe MC service user identity is also known as the MC service ID. The MC service ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents the MC service user. The MC service ID identifies an MC service user. The MC service ID may also identify one or more MC service user profiles for the user at the application layer.\\nThere are attributes associated with the MC service ID configured in the MC service that relate to the human user of the MC service. Typically, this information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify a user's organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user's service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example, if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that identifies a user's role as an incident commander could automatically be used by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.\\nThe MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where the MC service ID is defined. \\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the signalling control plane.\\nA default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile may be used. \\nFor the purposes of this document, an MC service administrator, MC service dispatcher, or MC service authorized user is an MC service user that has been granted special privileges within the context of the client function being performed (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration management client, key management client). For example, the MC service ID of a group management client of an MC service administrator can be authorized within the group management server to create new groups and add members to groups (i.e. administrative function), but is not authorized to dynamically create group or user regroups (i.e. operational function). Alternatively, for example, the MC service ID of a dispatcher will typically be authorized to dynamically create group and user regroups, but is not authorized to create new groups or add/delete members to groups. The MC service authorization framework is defined in TS\\u00a033.180\\u00a0[25].\\n8.1.3\\tMC service group identity (MC service group ID)\\n8.1.3.1\\tGeneral\\nThe MC service group identity is also known as the MC service group ID. The MC service group ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents a set of MC service users. The set of MC service users may belong to the same or different MC systems. The MC system for each user (within the group) is identified by each user's respective MC service ID.\\nThe MC service group ID identifies an MC service group in an MC system. It indicates the MC system where the MC service group is defined. It indicates the MC service server within the MC system where the group is defined as described in subclause 8.3.2.\\nThe MC service group ID is used as follows: \\na)\\tFor identifying a set of identities of its group members; and\\nb)\\tBy the MC service client to address the MC service group.\\nThe MC service group ID shall be a URI.\\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service group ID is hidden from the signalling control plane. \\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.379 [16], the MCPTT group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.281 [12], the MCVideo group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.282\\u00a0[13], the MCData group ID is an MC service group ID.\\n8.1.3.2\\tMC service group ID management (off-network operation)\\nIn off-network operation, an MC service group ID is used for identifying the MC service group while off-network. The MC service group ID should be resolved to the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the group communication. The MC service UE is able to make one or more MC service communications (as per the group configuration) with other member UEs whose users are of the same MC service group ID over ProSe direct communications based on ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast address, and utilising IPv4 or IPv6 as indicated by policy, as described in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14].\\nFigure\\u00a08.1.3.2-1 illustrates how the MC service group ID, ProSe Group IP multicast address and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are mapped to each other. ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in accordance with the MC service group ID. Thus, they are pre-defined and associated. This mapping information should be provisioned through UICC in the UE or through ProSe function as specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14], or be delivered from an application server. Mapping information is provisioned from group management server for online configuration, and provisioned from configuration management server for offline configuration.\\nNOTE:\\tTo define the retrieval mechanism of the off-network information (ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID) from ProSe function to group management server is out of scope of the present document.

The MCPTT server may perform the controlling role for private calls and group calls. The MCPTT server performing the controlling role for a private call or group call may also perform a participating role for the same private call or group call. For each private call and group call, there shall be only one MCPTT server assuming the controlling role, while one or more MCPTT servers in participating role may be involved. \\nThe MCPTT server performing the controlling roles is responsible for:\\n-\\tcall control (e.g. policy enforcement for participation in the MCPTT group calls) towards all the MCPTT users of the group call and private call;\\n-\\tinterfacing with the group management server for group policy and affiliation status information of this MCPTT server's served affiliated users;\\n-\\tenforcing functional alias priority handling;\\n-\\tmanaging floor control entity in a group call and private call; and\\n-\\tmanaging media handling entity in call i.e. conferencing, transcoding.\\nThe MCPTT server performing the functional alias controlling role is responsible for:\\n-\\tinterfacing with the functional alias management server for functional alias policy from the functional alias configuration;\\n-\\tfunctional alias activation, deactivation, take over and interrogation support for MCPTT user.\\nThe controlling roles for group call, private call and functional alias are independent with each other.\\nThe MCPTT server performing the participating roles is responsible for:\\n-\\tcall control (e.g. authorization for participation in the MCPTT group calls) to its MCPTT users for group call and private call;\\n-\\tgroup affiliation support for MCPTT user, including enforcement of maximum N2 number of simultaneous group affiliations by a user;\\n-\\tenforcing functional alias priority handling;\\n-\\trelaying the call control and floor control messages between the MCPTT client and the MCPTT server performing the controlling role; and\\n-\\tmedia handling in call for its MCPTT users, i.e. transcoding, recording, lawful interception for both unicast and multicast media.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tThe MCPTT server in the controlling role and the MCPTT server in the participating role can belong to the same MCPTT system or to different MCPTT systems.\\nFor group regrouping involving multiple groups from primary and partner MCPTT systems,\\n-\\tthe group host MCPTT server of the temporary group performs the controlling role and is responsible for the centralized floor control, and for arbitration according to the temporary group or user policies (e.g., priority);\\n-\\tthe group host MCPTT server of the constituent MCPTT group is responsible for providing call invitations to their group members, and for filtering between constituent group members' floor control requests according to the constituent group or user policies (e.g., priority); and\\n-\\tthe MCPTT server responsible for the constituent MCPTT group members performs the participating role.\\n7.4.2.3.3\\tFloor participant\\nThe floor participant functional entity is responsible for floor requests. This functional entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-network operations.\\n7.4.2.3.4\\tFloor control server\\nThis functional entity provides support for centralised floor control for on-network and distributed floor control for off-network operation. It may provide arbitration between floor control requests between different users, grant the floor in response to successful requests, and provide queuing in cases of contention. For on-network operation, this functional entity is located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.\\n7.4.2.3.5\\tMedia distribution function \\nThe media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server (e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following functionality:\\n-\\tprovide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\treplicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using unicast transport;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and\\n-\\tprovide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined (e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the MCPTT UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a01:\\tIf media mixing function occurs within the media distribution function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tA media mixing function within the media distribution function is not possible where the media is end to end encrypted.\\nGroup configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.\\nNOTE\\u00a03:\\tIf media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to minimize the feedback of the user's own voice from the mixed audio in order to avoid echoes.\\n7.4.2.3.6\\tMedia mixer\\nThis functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining multiple media streams (e.g. multi-talker control) into one media stream through the enforcement of media policy information.

The MCPTT user profile is determined by the mission critical organization, the MCPTT service provider, and potentially the MCPTT user.\\n7.4.2.3.8\\tMC gateway server\\nThe MC gateway server provides support for MCPTT interconnection services with a partner MCPTT system in a different trust domain whilst providing topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCPTT servers in the partner MCPTT system without needing to expose the MCPTT servers in the primary MCPTT system outside the trusted domain of the primary MCPTT system. It may be a role of the MCPTT server described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 of the present document.\\nThe MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor control signalling messages, and media between MCPTT servers within the MCPTT system and the interconnected MCPTT system.\\nEditor's note:\\tIt is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a033.180 [25].\",\n          \"Comments:\\nThe SDP answer contains all bit-rates from 9.6 to 32 kbps, with IPv4 for the send and the receive directions.\\nIn EVS AMR-WB IO mode, only 6.60, 8.85, and 12.65 kbps are used.\\nOnly Header-full format is used in the session.\\nA.14.3.4\\tSDP answer from MTSI client in terminal when up to super-wideband speech is negotiated\\nIn this example, the MTSI client in terminal includes narrowband, wideband, and super-wideband speech in the SDP answer.\\nTable A.14.9: SDP example Comments:\\nIt is assumed that 42 kbps is reserved for speech by the radio access technology.\\nAll bit-rates of EVS from 5.9 (SC-VBR) to 24.4 kbps are offered in the session.\\nThe MTSI client in terminal supports all bandwidths, up to super-wideband.\\nMedia level b=AS is computed for 24.4 kbps of EVS with Header-full payload format.\\nA.14.1.4\\tDual-mono\\nWhen dual-mono is offered, the SDP offer below can be used to initiate a speech session.

The AAA-2 reference point is used for:\\n-\\tauthentication and security to the service layer for migration;\\n8\\tIdentities\\n8.1\\tApplication plane\\n8.1.1\\tMission Critical user identity (MC ID)\\nThe mission critical user identity is also known as the MC ID. The MC ID is the identity that an MC service user presents to the identity management server during a user authentication transaction. In general, since identity management is a common service it uses an identity which is linked to a set of credentials (e.g. biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not necessarily be tied to a single mission critical service. The MC ID and the MC service ID may be the same. The MC ID uniquely identifies the MC service user to the identity management server. The MC ID is used by the identity management server to provide the identity management client a means for mission critical service authentication. \\nNOTE:\\tThe specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to use the MC user identity is specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a033.180 [25].\\n8.1.2\\tMC service user identity (MC service ID)\\nThe MC service user identity is also known as the MC service ID. The MC service ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents the MC service user. The MC service ID identifies an MC service user. The MC service ID may also identify one or more MC service user profiles for the user at the application layer.\\nThere are attributes associated with the MC service ID configured in the MC service that relate to the human user of the MC service. Typically, this information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify a user's organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user's service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example, if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that identifies a user's role as an incident commander could automatically be used by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.\\nThe MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where the MC service ID is defined. \\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the signalling control plane.\\nA default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile may be used. \\nFor the purposes of this document, an MC service administrator, MC service dispatcher, or MC service authorized user is an MC service user that has been granted special privileges within the context of the client function being performed (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration management client, key management client). For example, the MC service ID of a group management client of an MC service administrator can be authorized within the group management server to create new groups and add members to groups (i.e. administrative function), but is not authorized to dynamically create group or user regroups (i.e. operational function). Alternatively, for example, the MC service ID of a dispatcher will typically be authorized to dynamically create group and user regroups, but is not authorized to create new groups or add/delete members to groups. The MC service authorization framework is defined in TS\\u00a033.180\\u00a0[25].\\n8.1.3\\tMC service group identity (MC service group ID)\\n8.1.3.1\\tGeneral\\nThe MC service group identity is also known as the MC service group ID. The MC service group ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents a set of MC service users. The set of MC service users may belong to the same or different MC systems. The MC system for each user (within the group) is identified by each user's respective MC service ID.\\nThe MC service group ID identifies an MC service group in an MC system. It indicates the MC system where the MC service group is defined. It indicates the MC service server within the MC system where the group is defined as described in subclause 8.3.2.\\nThe MC service group ID is used as follows: \\na)\\tFor identifying a set of identities of its group members; and\\nb)\\tBy the MC service client to address the MC service group.\\nThe MC service group ID shall be a URI.\\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service group ID is hidden from the signalling control plane. \\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.379 [16], the MCPTT group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.281 [12], the MCVideo group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.282\\u00a0[13], the MCData group ID is an MC service group ID.\\n8.1.3.2\\tMC service group ID management (off-network operation)\\nIn off-network operation, an MC service group ID is used for identifying the MC service group while off-network. The MC service group ID should be resolved to the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the group communication. The MC service UE is able to make one or more MC service communications (as per the group configuration) with other member UEs whose users are of the same MC service group ID over ProSe direct communications based on ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast address, and utilising IPv4 or IPv6 as indicated by policy, as described in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14].\\nFigure\\u00a08.1.3.2-1 illustrates how the MC service group ID, ProSe Group IP multicast address and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are mapped to each other. ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in accordance with the MC service group ID. Thus, they are pre-defined and associated. This mapping information should be provisioned through UICC in the UE or through ProSe function as specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14], or be delivered from an application server. Mapping information is provisioned from group management server for online configuration, and provisioned from configuration management server for offline configuration.\\nNOTE:\\tTo define the retrieval mechanism of the off-network information (ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID) from ProSe function to group management server is out of scope of the present document.

For on-network operation, this functional entity is located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.\\n7.4.2.3.5\\tMedia distribution function \\nThe media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server (e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following functionality:\\n-\\tprovide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\treplicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using unicast transport;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and\\n-\\tprovide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined (e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the MCPTT UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a01:\\tIf media mixing function occurs within the media distribution function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tA media mixing function within the media distribution function is not possible where the media is end to end encrypted.\\nGroup configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.\\nNOTE\\u00a03:\\tIf media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to minimize the feedback of the user's own voice from the mixed audio in order to avoid echoes.\\n7.4.2.3.6\\tMedia mixer\\nThis functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining multiple media streams (e.g. multi-talker control) into one media stream through the enforcement of media policy information.

The bit-rate available for data will be reduced further from the overhead for RLC and MAC headers.\\nAll bit-rates of EVS from 5.9 (SC-VBR) to 24.4 kbps are offered in the session.\\nThe MTSI client in terminal supports narrowband and wideband.\\nMedia level b=AS is computed for 24.4 kbps of EVS with Header-full payload format, or for 23.85 which results in a b=AS value of 33 kbps. MCS lower than MCS-7 would necessitate the use of mode-set parameter for AMR-WB as MCS-6 supports only 29.6 kbps. However, higher MCS values would leave lower overhead for channel coding.\\nA.14.1.3\\tNR/E-UTRAN/HSPA\\nWhen the access technology is E-UTRAN or HSPA, the SDP offer below can be used to initiate a speech session. In this example, RTP Payload Type 97 is defined for EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 98 and 99, and 100 and 101 are defined for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.\\nTable A.14.3: SDP example [1] Tdoc SP-180322, \\u201cEnhancement of LTE for Efficient delivery of streaming service (eLSTR)\\u201d \\n[2] TS\\u00a022.115 V16.3.0 (2019-06); \\u201cService aspects; Charging and billing\\u201d\\n[3] TS\\u00a022.278 V16.3.0 (2019-06); \\u201cService requirements for the Evolved Packet System (EPS)\\u201d\\nGiven the above context, select the correct answer to the question from the multiple choice options below.

The AAA-2 reference point is used for:\\n-\\tauthentication and security to the service layer for migration;\\n8\\tIdentities\\n8.1\\tApplication plane\\n8.1.1\\tMission Critical user identity (MC ID)\\nThe mission critical user identity is also known as the MC ID. The MC ID is the identity that an MC service user presents to the identity management server during a user authentication transaction. In general, since identity management is a common service it uses an identity which is linked to a set of credentials (e.g. biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not necessarily be tied to a single mission critical service. The MC ID and the MC service ID may be the same. The MC ID uniquely identifies the MC service user to the identity management server. The MC ID is used by the identity management server to provide the identity management client a means for mission critical service authentication. \\nNOTE:\\tThe specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to use the MC user identity is specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a033.180 [25].\\n8.1.2\\tMC service user identity (MC service ID)\\nThe MC service user identity is also known as the MC service ID. The MC service ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents the MC service user. The MC service ID identifies an MC service user. The MC service ID may also identify one or more MC service user profiles for the user at the application layer.\\nThere are attributes associated with the MC service ID configured in the MC service that relate to the human user of the MC service. Typically, this information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify a user's organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user's service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example, if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that identifies a user's role as an incident commander could automatically be used by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.\\nThe MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where the MC service ID is defined. \\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the signalling control plane.\\nA default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile may be used. \\nFor the purposes of this document, an MC service administrator, MC service dispatcher, or MC service authorized user is an MC service user that has been granted special privileges within the context of the client function being performed (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration management client, key management client). For example, the MC service ID of a group management client of an MC service administrator can be authorized within the group management server to create new groups and add members to groups (i.e. administrative function), but is not authorized to dynamically create group or user regroups (i.e. operational function). Alternatively, for example, the MC service ID of a dispatcher will typically be authorized to dynamically create group and user regroups, but is not authorized to create new groups or add/delete members to groups. The MC service authorization framework is defined in TS\\u00a033.180\\u00a0[25].\\n8.1.3\\tMC service group identity (MC service group ID)\\n8.1.3.1\\tGeneral\\nThe MC service group identity is also known as the MC service group ID. The MC service group ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents a set of MC service users. The set of MC service users may belong to the same or different MC systems. The MC system for each user (within the group) is identified by each user's respective MC service ID.\\nThe MC service group ID identifies an MC service group in an MC system. It indicates the MC system where the MC service group is defined. It indicates the MC service server within the MC system where the group is defined as described in subclause 8.3.2.\\nThe MC service group ID is used as follows: \\na)\\tFor identifying a set of identities of its group members; and\\nb)\\tBy the MC service client to address the MC service group.\\nThe MC service group ID shall be a URI.\\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service group ID is hidden from the signalling control plane. \\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.379 [16], the MCPTT group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.281 [12], the MCVideo group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.282\\u00a0[13], the MCData group ID is an MC service group ID.\\n8.1.3.2\\tMC service group ID management (off-network operation)\\nIn off-network operation, an MC service group ID is used for identifying the MC service group while off-network. The MC service group ID should be resolved to the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the group communication. The MC service UE is able to make one or more MC service communications (as per the group configuration) with other member UEs whose users are of the same MC service group ID over ProSe direct communications based on ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast address, and utilising IPv4 or IPv6 as indicated by policy, as described in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14].\\nFigure\\u00a08.1.3.2-1 illustrates how the MC service group ID, ProSe Group IP multicast address and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are mapped to each other. ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in accordance with the MC service group ID. Thus, they are pre-defined and associated. This mapping information should be provisioned through UICC in the UE or through ProSe function as specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14], or be delivered from an application server. Mapping information is provisioned from group management server for online configuration, and provisioned from configuration management server for offline configuration.\\nNOTE:\\tTo define the retrieval mechanism of the off-network information (ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID) from ProSe function to group management server is out of scope of the present document.

For on-network operation, this functional entity is located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.\\n7.4.2.3.5\\tMedia distribution function \\nThe media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server (e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following functionality:\\n-\\tprovide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\treplicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using unicast transport;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and\\n-\\tprovide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined (e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the MCPTT UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a01:\\tIf media mixing function occurs within the media distribution function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tA media mixing function within the media distribution function is not possible where the media is end to end encrypted.\\nGroup configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.\\nNOTE\\u00a03:\\tIf media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to minimize the feedback of the user's own voice from the mixed audio in order to avoid echoes.\\n7.4.2.3.6\\tMedia mixer\\nThis functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining multiple media streams (e.g. multi-talker control) into one media stream through the enforcement of media policy information.

It acts as a proxy for one or more MCPTT servers in the partner MCPTT system without needing to expose the MCPTT servers in the primary MCPTT system outside the trusted domain of the primary MCPTT system. It may be a role of the MCPTT server described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 of the present document.\\nThe MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor control signalling messages, and media between MCPTT servers within the MCPTT system and the interconnected MCPTT system.\\nEditor's note:\\tIt is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a033.180 [25].\",\n          \"Comments:\\nThe SDP answer contains all bit-rates from 9.6 to 32 kbps, with IPv4 for the send and the receive directions.\\nIn EVS AMR-WB IO mode, only 6.60, 8.85, and 12.65 kbps are used.\\nOnly Header-full format is used in the session.\\nA.14.3.4\\tSDP answer from MTSI client in terminal when up to super-wideband speech is negotiated\\nIn this example, the MTSI client in terminal includes narrowband, wideband, and super-wideband speech in the SDP answer.\\nTable A.14.9: SDP example Comments:\\nIt is assumed that 42 kbps is reserved for speech by the radio access technology.\\nAll bit-rates of EVS from 5.9 (SC-VBR) to 24.4 kbps are offered in the session.\\nThe MTSI client in terminal supports all bandwidths, up to super-wideband.\\nMedia level b=AS is computed for 24.4 kbps of EVS with Header-full payload format.\\nA.14.1.4\\tDual-mono\\nWhen dual-mono is offered, the SDP offer below can be used to initiate a speech session.

The AAA-2 reference point is used for:\\n-\\tauthentication and security to the service layer for migration;\\n8\\tIdentities\\n8.1\\tApplication plane\\n8.1.1\\tMission Critical user identity (MC ID)\\nThe mission critical user identity is also known as the MC ID. The MC ID is the identity that an MC service user presents to the identity management server during a user authentication transaction. In general, since identity management is a common service it uses an identity which is linked to a set of credentials (e.g. biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not necessarily be tied to a single mission critical service. The MC ID and the MC service ID may be the same. The MC ID uniquely identifies the MC service user to the identity management server. The MC ID is used by the identity management server to provide the identity management client a means for mission critical service authentication. \\nNOTE:\\tThe specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to use the MC user identity is specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a033.180 [25].\\n8.1.2\\tMC service user identity (MC service ID)\\nThe MC service user identity is also known as the MC service ID. The MC service ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents the MC service user. The MC service ID identifies an MC service user. The MC service ID may also identify one or more MC service user profiles for the user at the application layer.\\nThere are attributes associated with the MC service ID configured in the MC service that relate to the human user of the MC service. Typically, this information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify a user's organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user's service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example, if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that identifies a user's role as an incident commander could automatically be used by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.\\nThe MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where the MC service ID is defined. \\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the signalling control plane.\\nA default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile may be used. \\nFor the purposes of this document, an MC service administrator, MC service dispatcher, or MC service authorized user is an MC service user that has been granted special privileges within the context of the client function being performed (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration management client, key management client). For example, the MC service ID of a group management client of an MC service administrator can be authorized within the group management server to create new groups and add members to groups (i.e. administrative function), but is not authorized to dynamically create group or user regroups (i.e. operational function). Alternatively, for example, the MC service ID of a dispatcher will typically be authorized to dynamically create group and user regroups, but is not authorized to create new groups or add/delete members to groups. The MC service authorization framework is defined in TS\\u00a033.180\\u00a0[25].\\n8.1.3\\tMC service group identity (MC service group ID)\\n8.1.3.1\\tGeneral\\nThe MC service group identity is also known as the MC service group ID. The MC service group ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that represents a set of MC service users. The set of MC service users may belong to the same or different MC systems. The MC system for each user (within the group) is identified by each user's respective MC service ID.\\nThe MC service group ID identifies an MC service group in an MC system. It indicates the MC system where the MC service group is defined. It indicates the MC service server within the MC system where the group is defined as described in subclause 8.3.2.\\nThe MC service group ID is used as follows: \\na)\\tFor identifying a set of identities of its group members; and\\nb)\\tBy the MC service client to address the MC service group.\\nThe MC service group ID shall be a URI.\\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service group ID is hidden from the signalling control plane. \\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.379 [16], the MCPTT group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.281 [12], the MCVideo group ID is an MC service group ID.\\nIn 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.282\\u00a0[13], the MCData group ID is an MC service group ID.\\n8.1.3.2\\tMC service group ID management (off-network operation)\\nIn off-network operation, an MC service group ID is used for identifying the MC service group while off-network. The MC service group ID should be resolved to the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the group communication. The MC service UE is able to make one or more MC service communications (as per the group configuration) with other member UEs whose users are of the same MC service group ID over ProSe direct communications based on ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast address, and utilising IPv4 or IPv6 as indicated by policy, as described in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14].\\nFigure\\u00a08.1.3.2-1 illustrates how the MC service group ID, ProSe Group IP multicast address and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are mapped to each other. ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in accordance with the MC service group ID. Thus, they are pre-defined and associated. This mapping information should be provisioned through UICC in the UE or through ProSe function as specified in 3GPP\\u00a0TS\\u00a023.303\\u00a0[14], or be delivered from an application server. Mapping information is provisioned from group management server for online configuration, and provisioned from configuration management server for offline configuration.\\nNOTE:\\tTo define the retrieval mechanism of the off-network information (ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID) from ProSe function to group management server is out of scope of the present document.

For on-network operation, this functional entity is located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.\\n7.4.2.3.5\\tMedia distribution function \\nThe media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server (e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following functionality:\\n-\\tprovide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\treplicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using unicast transport;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference point;\\n-\\tdistribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and\\n-\\tprovide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined (e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the MCPTT UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a01:\\tIf media mixing function occurs within the media distribution function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.\\nNOTE\\u00a02:\\tA media mixing function within the media distribution function is not possible where the media is end to end encrypted.\\nGroup configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.\\nNOTE\\u00a03:\\tIf media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to minimize the feedback of the user's own voice from the mixed audio in order to avoid echoes.\\n7.4.2.3.6\\tMedia mixer\\nThis functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining multiple media streams (e.g. multi-talker control) into one media stream through the enforcement of media policy information.

In this example, RTP Payload Type 97 is defined for EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 98 and 99, and 100 and 101 are defined for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.\\nTable A.14.2: SDP example Comments:\\nIt is assumed that the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) of EGPRS used in this session is MCS-7\\u00a0[132] or higher, which supports at least 44.8 kbps. The bit-rate available for data will be reduced further from the overhead for RLC and MAC headers.\\nAll bit-rates of EVS from 5.9 (SC-VBR) to 24.4 kbps are offered in the session.\\nThe MTSI client in terminal supports narrowband and wideband.\\nMedia level b=AS is computed for 24.4 kbps of EVS with Header-full payload format, or for 23.85 which results in a b=AS value of 33 kbps. MCS lower than MCS-7 would necessitate the use of mode-set parameter for AMR-WB as MCS-6 supports only 29.6 kbps. However, higher MCS values would leave lower overhead for channel coding.\\nA.14.1.3\\tNR/E-UTRAN/HSPA\\nWhen the access technology is E-UTRAN or HSPA, the SDP offer below can be used to initiate a speech session. In this example, RTP Payload Type 97 is defined for EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 98 and 99, and 100 and 101 are defined for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.\\nTable A.14.3: SDP example [1] Tdoc SP-180322, \\u201cEnhancement of LTE for Efficient delivery of streaming service (eLSTR)\\u201d \\n[2] TS\\u00a022.115 V16.3.0 (2019-06); \\u201cService aspects; Charging and billing\\u201d\\n[3] TS\\u00a022.278 V16.3.0 (2019-06); \\u201cService requirements for the Evolved Packet System (EPS)\\u201d\\nGiven the above context, select the correct answer to the question from the multiple choice options below. Use only the option number (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) as your answer.\\nQuestion: What are the peak packet data rates supported by the Evolved Packet System on the radio access bearer?\\nOptions:\\n1. 100 Mbps
